Object Detection with TensorFlow

This is a simple object detection program using TensorFlow. The program takes as input a video file, and uses a trained TensorFlow model to detect objects in each frame of the video. The detected objects are then labeled and visualized in the output video.

Requirements

This program requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Usage

To run the program, you need to provide the following command-line arguments:

--model_path: Path to the TensorFlow SavedModel directory.
--label_map: Path to the label map.
--input: Path to the input video file.
--output: Path to the output video file.
